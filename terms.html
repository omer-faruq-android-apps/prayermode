<p><strong>Last Updated: June 25, 2025</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Prayer mode! These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of the Prayer mode mobile application (the "App"), provided by Mohamed Brahim Yahyaoui ("we," "us," or "our," referring to the developer). By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
<p>By accessing or using the App, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you may not use the App.</p>

<h2>2. License to Use the App</h2>
<p>This App is free and open-source software, licensed under the terms of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GNU General Public License v3.0</a>. This license grants you the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software for any purpose, including commercially. These freedoms are conditional on you following the terms of the GPLv3 license, which includes making the source code available for any distributed versions.</p>
<p>The source code for this App is publicly available at <a href="https://prayermode.github.io/prayermode/">this repository</a>. This transparency allows you to verify its functionality and privacy practices.</p>
<p>Use of certain features of the App, such as automatic Do Not Disturb mode and continuous prayer time updates, requires specific device permissions (Location access, notification control, Do Not Disturb mode, Alarm & reminders and Background Location). By using these features, you consent to the App requesting and utilizing these permissions.</p>

<h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>You agree not to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in any way that violates any applicable local, national, or international law.</li>
    <li>Modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any portion of the App.</li>
    <li>Remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the App.</li>
    <li>Use the App in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Disclaimers and Important Acknowledgements</h2>

<h3>a. Prayer Time Accuracy</h3>
<p>The prayer times provided by the App are calculations based on data from <a href="https://aladhan.com/" target="_blank">aladhan.com</a>'s API, using your device's location and selected calculation methods. While we strive for accuracy, various factors (such as local astronomical conditions, specific madhabs, or local mosque timings) may lead to slight variations. We do not guarantee the absolute precision of prayer times and recommend verifying with local religious authorities if absolute accuracy is required.</p>

<h3>b. Do Not Disturb (DND) Mode Functionality</h3>
<p>The App's Do Not Disturb (DND) mode feature is designed to temporarily silence notifications during prayer times. By granting the necessary permissions for this feature, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The App will automatically activate DND mode on your device at calculated prayer times.</li>
    <li>While DND mode is active, you may not receive standard notifications, including phone calls, messages, and emergency alerts.</li>
    <li>It is your sole responsibility to understand how DND mode operates on your specific device and to configure any emergency bypass settings (e.g., allowing calls from starred contacts) according to your needs.</li>
    <li>We shall not be held responsible or liable for any consequences, damages, losses, or missed communications (including emergency calls) resulting from the App's activation of DND mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (I) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE APP; (II) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE APP; (III) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE APP; AND (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

<h2>6. Governing Law</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Morocco, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

<h2>7. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>We believe that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting us directly. If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree to contact us at <a href="mailto:prayer.mode@outlook.com">prayer.mode@outlook.com</a> to attempt to resolve the issue directly.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any material changes (e.g., via app updates or on our website where this policy is hosted). By continuing to access or use our App after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the App.</p>

<h2>9. Donations</h2>

If you find this app valuable and wish to support its continued development, you can make a voluntary donation.
